# Interpolation from mostly scratch
This repo contains the construction of stable diffusion from its main components of the autoencoder, scheduler, text_embedding, and unet.

After completing this, I decided to explore image interpolation by moving from the latent space of one image to another using linear, cosine, and slerp techniques.
